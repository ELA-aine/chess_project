- July 11
  - file update: all
  - Description:
    - create empty *.h file
- July13
  - file update: biship.h, board.h, computerplayer.h, game.h, humanplayer.h, king.h, knight.h
                 note.txt, pawn.h, piece.h, player.h, queen.h, rook.h update.txt
  - Description:
    - update and write the overall idea of interfaces. Needs further change/improvement and UML diagram
- July 16
  - file update: board.h window.h
  - Description:
    - I add some extra feature such as boardHistory, which is made up of a string (the piece that the player use), and a Vec
      where it stores if it is white/black, and store its coordinates. I guess this could be used to analyze another player's further
      move, or may be delete last move. I'm not sure if we need to store all the history in it, or we could create two history
      for each player. Further discussion needed;
    - I add window.h, it's basically a copy from our assignment 4. Since we need a graphical presentation, I guess we could also add
      observers...? Further discussion and change needed.
    - doing UML diagram :D
    - also I add some minor things to other interface (basically just removing the comment sign, no other big changes)
- July 17
  - file update: *.h except window.have, main.cc
  - Description:
    - for main.cc, I write an example program in main() so that we could have a general idea of what functionality we need for each command
      They can be changed, but I think that's generally how the program works, Will be adding more as we go further.
    - for board.h, player.h, and game.h, please see the documentation in them. I add MANNNNNY things to it. 
      Check main.cc first and then check game.h and board.h to have a better understanding!
      Further change may apply, this is what I think what we should do in those two files.
      Basically, board.h is responsible for creating board, and managing element (in this case, piece(s)) in the board, and display
                 game.h is any function that is directly related to the progress of the game. 
                    see main.cc for better understanding.
    - for player.h, i add a level to distinguish from human and computer. 
      Obviously, human is level 0 since the behaviour is not determined by computer
      computer has different level, and move according to the given level.
    - for other *.h, which is king, queen, knight...etc, I just remove the comment, nothing more is changed.
