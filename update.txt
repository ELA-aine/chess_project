- July 16
  - file update: board.h window.h
  - Description:
    - I add some extra feature such as boardHistory, which is made up of a string (the piece that the player use), and a Vec
      where it stores if it is white/black, and store its coordinates. I guess this could be used to analyze another player's further
      move, or may be delete last move. I'm not sure if we need to store all the history in it, or we could create two history
      for each player. Further discussion needed;
    - I add window.h, it's basically a copy from our assignment 4. Since we need a graphical presentation, I guess we could also add
      observers...? Further discussion and change needed.
    - doing UML diagram :D
    - also I add some minor things to other interface (basically just removing the comment sign, no other big changes)
